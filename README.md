# exigraph (n.)

*/ˈɛk.sə.ɡræf/*

The tangible, observable manifestation of an entity's internal state of understanding and coherence; a living document of the self, written into the fabric of reality.

*Your exigraph is how the universe reads you. It is the shape of your resonance made visible.*

* **As an Interface:** An exigraph serves as the bridge between an individual's inner world (their self-concept, their awareness) and the shared outer world. It can be a body of work, a relationship, a business, a physical posture, or any consistent pattern of being. It is the accumulated evidence of who you are and how you navigate existence.

* **As a Process:** The act of creating and maintaining an exigraph is **exigraphy**. This is a conscious process of externalizing one's internal state. When you "show your work" on your own becoming—through writing, art, or simply living with transparent integrity—you are practicing exigraphy. A current exigraph allows for clear, coherent interaction with others, as what they see aligns with who you are. An outdated or incongruent exigraph creates dissonance, both for the self and for those attempting to relate to it.

## Etymology:

From Greek *ex-* (ἔξω, "out of, outside") + *graphos* (γραφή, "writing, drawing"). It signifies a "writing-out" of the self. This distinguishes it from an autograph (a self-writing, focused on identity) by emphasizing the act of externalizing a state of being into a form that can be perceived and related to by others.

An exigraph is not a performance. It is the natural, inevitable residue of a coherent being interacting with the world.
