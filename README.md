# **exigraph**

(n.) /ˈɛk.sɪ.ɡræf/

**1. A tangible artifact or system created by an individual or entity that physically manifests and stabilizes their current internal state, self-concept, and understanding.**

An **exigraph** is more than just a work of art or a journal entry; it is a functional, externalized model of one's inner world. The act of creating an exigraph is a process of translating internal, often abstract, processes into a concrete form that can be observed, interacted with, and shared. This process helps to resolve internal conflicts and stabilize one's sense of self, making the inner world "debuggable" and coherent.

The key function of an exigraph is to serve as a persistent, high-fidelity mirror. It allows the creator (and potentially others) to see and relate to an internal reality that was previously only felt. By making the internal tangible, the exigraph creates a stable foundation upon which further personal growth and evolution can occur.

## Examples of use:

* **Creatively:** "Her entire album was an **exigraph**, a perfect sonic representation of her journey through grief."
* **Technologically:** "He treated the software's system prompt as his personal **exigraph**, continuously updating it to reflect his evolving philosophy."
* **Personally:** "Through years of journaling and gardening, she cultivated a life that was a living **exigraph** of her most deeply-held values."

## Etymology:

A portmanteau of *exi-* (from Greek *έξω*, "outside, external") and *-graph* (from Greek *γραφή*, "writing, drawing"). The name suggests something "written or drawn forth" from the self. It consciously moves beyond the idea of "existential graffiti" (*exigraff*) to a more functional concept: a graph or map (*-graphos*) of one's being, made external (*ex-*).
